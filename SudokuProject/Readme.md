# Sudoku Solver Project

## Overview

This project is a Sudoku solver where you will complete specific parts of the code marked with `TODO` comments. The goal is to implement functionalities to generate, solve, and handle Sudoku puzzles.

A `DEBUG` mode is available for verifying your implementation. When running in non-`DEBUG` mode, the program will output files in the `data` folder, typically found inside the `cmake-build-debug` directory.

> **Important:** This project is **strongly recommended** to be run using **CLion**. If you wish to use **VSCode**, utilize the provided `buildrun.sh` script. Feel free to reach out if you encounter any issues.

## Assignment Submission

The submission is divided into **three parts**:

### Part 1: Complete the Code

- Finish all sections marked with `TODO`.
- Implement the puzzle generator, solvers, and utility functions.
- Ensure your code runs correctly in both DEBUG and non-DEBUG modes.

### Part 2: Visualize Program Flow

- Use the following sample code to understand how to visualize program flow:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

void greet() {
    std::cout << "Hello from greet()\n";
}

int factorial(int n) {
    if (n <= 1) return 1;
    return n * factorial(n - 1);
}

void compute() {
    std::cout << "Inside compute()\n";
    greet();
    int num = 5;
    int fact = factorial(num);
    std::cout << "Factorial of " << num << " is " << fact << "\n";
}

int main() {
    std::cout << "Starting main()\n";
    compute();
    std::cout << "Ending main()\n";
    return 0;
}
```

- Sample flow:

```text
main()
‚îÇ
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ compute()
‚îÇ   ‚îÇ
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ greet()
‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ [Prints "Hello from greet()"]
‚îÇ   ‚îÇ
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ factorial(5)
‚îÇ       ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ [Recursively calls factorial(n-1) until n == 1]
‚îÇ       ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ [Returns result to compute()]
‚îÇ
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ [Prints "Ending main()"]
```

- Create a similar flowchart to illustrate the execution flow of your Sudoku solver in non-DEBUG mode.

### Part 3: Reflective Questions

Answer the following questions in your report:

1. Group Photo
2. What contributions did your friends make? List them.
3. Why do you think `efficientSolver` took more time than the regular solver? What strategies would you implement to make `efficientSolver` actually efficient?
4. Can you make this a generalized solution, meaning board that can solve any NxN grid where N is a square number? Can you briefly share your ideas?
5. Did this project challenge and motivate you? We would appreciate your feedback on your experience. Feel free to share what you learned, what aspects of the project you found most engaging or challenging, and any suggestions you have for improving future projects. Your insights are valuable in helping us enhance future learning experiences.

## Running the Project

### Using CLion (Recommended)

1. Open the project in **CLion**.
2. Set the configuration to `DEBUG` mode if you want to verify your implementation.
3. Run the project.
4. In **non-DEBUG** mode, output files will be saved in:
   ```
   cmake-build-debug/data/
   ```

### Using VSCode

1. Open the project in **VSCode**.
2. Use the provided `buildrun.sh` script to compile and run the project:
   ```bash
   ./buildrun.sh full/path/to/your/project/folder
   ```
   or,
   ```bash
   bash buildrun.sh full/path/to/your/project/folder
   ```
   or,
   ```bash
   sh buildrun.sh full/path/to/your/project/folder
   ```
3. If you face any issues, reach out for assistance.

## Debug Mode

- **DEBUG mode** includes a special `main` function for testing and verifying your code.
- This mode helps ensure your solutions work before running in production.

## Output

- In **non-DEBUG** mode, the program will read puzzles from `data/puzzles/` and write solutions to `data/solutions/`.

Happy coding and feel free to ask questions if anything is unclear!
