/**
 * @file sudoku_io.h
 * @brief Input/Output utility functions for handling Sudoku puzzles.
 *
 * This header file declares functions for reading, writing, displaying,
 * and managing Sudoku puzzles. It includes utilities to:
 * - Print Sudoku boards to the console with color-coded hints.
 * - Read and write Sudoku puzzles from/to files.
 * - Parse and extract numbers from text representations.
 * - Generate and solve multiple Sudoku puzzles.
 * - Handle file system operations to read puzzle sets from directories.
 *
 * The functions work with a dynamically allocated 9x9 Sudoku board
 * represented as `int**`, where empty cells are denoted by 0.
